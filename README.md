# Sustainability-Consultant---Desi-Hangover-


Led a sustainable development analysis for Desi Hangover, a purpose-driven Indian footwear brand that combines traditional craftsmanship with ethical, eco-conscious production. The project aimed to assess the company’s business practices against the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using frameworks such as Stakeholder Theory, the Global Goals Relationship Matrix, and the Equality, Discrimination, and Fairness paradigm.

The analysis highlighted how Desi Hangover promotes social inclusion, fair wages, gender equality, and environmental responsibility through initiatives like employing rural cobbler artisans, integrating women into skilled production roles, using upcycled leather, and adopting organic tanning methods. These practices demonstrated alignment with key SDGs, including SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production).

Key findings also identified vulnerabilities, such as the brand’s reliance on livestock by-products for raw materials, potential artisan income insecurity due to non-traditional employment structures, and inefficiencies in resource use during scaling. While these risks were balanced by the company’s strong stakeholder-focused model, they presented strategic challenges to long-term sustainability.

Developed practical, targeted recommendations to strengthen sustainability performance and business resilience, including:
	•	Exploring plant-based and biodegradable leather alternatives.
	•	Investing in renewable energy solutions for small-scale production.
	•	Obtaining sustainability and quality certifications (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, Leather Working Group).
	•	Implementing lean manufacturing and Six Sigma methods to reduce waste and improve efficiency.

The project concluded that Desi Hangover’s operational model successfully blends heritage preservation with sustainability and innovation. The proposed strategies were designed to enhance competitive advantage, mitigate supply chain and environmental risks, and solidify the company’s position as a socially responsible, purpose-led brand.
